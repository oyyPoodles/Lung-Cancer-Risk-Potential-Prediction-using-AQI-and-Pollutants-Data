# 🌍 Lung Cancer Detection from AQI using Machine Learning

## 📌 Overview
This project studies the link between **air pollution** (PM2.5, PM10, NO₂, SO₂, CO, O₃) and **lung cancer risk** using machine learning.  
It applies statistical analysis and ML models to support **early diagnosis** and raise **public health awareness**.

## 🚀 Methodology
- Data preprocessing & cleaning of AQI and cancer cases  
- Exploratory Data Analysis (heatmaps, scatter plots, regression)  
- Models: Logistic Regression, Random Forest, SVM, Bayesian Logistic Regression  
- Metrics: Accuracy, Precision, Recall, F1-score, ROC-AUC  

## 📊 Results
- Strong correlation between pollutants & cancer risk  
- Linear regression & heatmaps show clear patterns  
- ML models achieved high performance in prediction  

## 🛠 Tech Stack
Python, Pandas, NumPy, Matplotlib, Seaborn, Scikit-learn, Jupyter Notebook  

## 📂 Dataset
Includes air quality indicators and lung cancer cases
